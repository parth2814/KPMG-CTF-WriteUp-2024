- As per the decryption given, we have to access the HVAC system and try to subscribe to all the subtopics.
- So first of all, I donâ€™t know how to access the mqtt service, so I just did a Google search and got the treasure.
- [**`1883: Pentesting MQTT (Mosquitto)`**](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/1883-pentesting-mqtt-mosquitto)
- From this, I know which tool to use and how to use it, so I use `Mosquito.`

```bash
apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients # Install the tool
```

- From Blog, I used the -t option for subscribing to all the subtopics, and from that, I got the flag. ðŸ•º
